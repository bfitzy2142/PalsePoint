# PalsePoint

PalsePoint is a simple program designed to automatically control a Wi-Fi smart switch based on the user specified switchpoint heartrate value. The idea is that this would allow you to connect any fan you have to this switch and effectively now have a smart fan such as that of the Kickr Headwind. This program will allow you to compete your workout completely hands free. Need to take a break, but don't want to get off the trainer to turn off the fan? Or have to head to the bathroom quuckly? No problem, your fan will only turn on when it is needed.

## Installation

Note that this project only works on Windows and with a EdiMax smart switch. To install simply clone/download this repo. However if you do not have an EdiMax switch, do not be discouraged. Provided your smart plug has an open API, you should be able to write a module similar to lean_smartplug.py.

## Usage

```bash
python PalsePoint.py
```
